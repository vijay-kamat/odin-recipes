    <h3><p>Bhelpuri is a savoury snack originally from India, and is also a type of chaat.It is made of puffed rice, crumbled crunchy puri,<br>onions, cilantro and tossed with two chutneys: a green spicy cilantro chutney and a brown tangy tamarind chutney.</p></h3>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul><h4>
        <li>Bhel - This main ingredient is readily available in Indian grocery stores. There are a few brands that make Bhel some spicer than others. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep brand Bhel as it is not overly spicy and also includes pieces of Papdi in it.</li>
        <li>Chutneys - cilantro mint chutney for spicy flavors and tamarind chutney for a sweet and tangy flavor</li>
        <li>Potato - steamed, peeled, and cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>Onion and tomato - finely diced onions and tomatoes. Both are optional but add lovely texture and flavor</li>
        <li>Spices - Kashmiri red chili, ground cumin, and chaat masala add earthy warm flavors</li>
        <li>Garnish - Sprinkle over lots of finely chopped cilantro and I would also recommend adding pomegranates for a pop of color and fun texture!</li>

    <br>
    <h3>Serving:</h3>
   <h4><p>Bhel Puri is best served immediately as it will get soggy over time. To serve for a party, you can prepare all the add-ons and keep them in individual bowls. </p>
    <p>Mix just before serving or have your guests mix Bhel Puri to their liking so they can add more or less of the chutneys, yogurt, spices, etc. Add a squeeze of <br>fresh lemon juice for a bright tangy flavor.</p>
